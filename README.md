# OptionPricingTheory
I try to explain in option pricing theory in an intuitive and simple to grasp manner.

I just completed my first semester in my Masters in Quantitative Finance module, and one of the modules I took - Stochastic Modelling in Finance, had led me to realize that I had a very poor understanding of basic probability and statistics. Combined with complex calculus, Brownian motion, and other Mathematical Axioms, I struggled quite a fair bit for this course. "Teaching something is learning it twice". Here, I attempt to break it down in an intuitive and simple to understand manner while I stress test my existing understanding of these topics.

## Introduction
One thing I realized about Mathematics in academia is that, there will be one (if not several) complex mathematical axioms built upon other more simple mathematical axioms in an iterative way. Put simply, there many nested concepts, each relying on a simpler concept to explain a phenomena. Below I layout the more basic fundamental mathematical axioms required in option pricing theory for us to have a complete understanding of the topics.

### Building Blocks

    - Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, Covariance

3. Calculus
    - Differentiation:
      - Chain Rule, Power rule, Exponential rule
      - Partial Differentiation
      - Differentiation by Parts
    - Integration
      - Reverse Chain Rule, Exponential Rule, Power Rule
    - Moment Generating Functions
