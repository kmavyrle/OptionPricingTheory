    "## Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we move on to the slightly more complicated statistical measures, the first of which being variance. I believe many feel that they have a strong grasp of simple statistical measures (myself included) related to variance, but it was not until I had to use them for more complex computations in option pricing did I realize that I only had a very surface-level understanding.\n",
    "Variance is the foundation of standard deviation, covariance, and correlation, all of which are very important measures in Quantitative Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, variance is a measure of how spread out a set of observations are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, in the context of Mathematics, we say variance is a measure of dispersion of a group of observations. In the application of variance in drawing relationships of real-life observations, we find that the larger the variance of an observation, the harder it is to say with confidence, that a particular sample of a distribution will be close to the mean. Recall in the above we say that the mean is the expectation of a distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as an example, we can say that we expect the height of a random guy in Singapore to have a height of 171 cm, but if the variance is very high, we are unable to say, with a high level of confidence, that for a random guy we find in Singaore, his height would be around 171 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Variance (\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sum^N_{i=1} (x_i -\\tilde{x})^2}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\tilde{x}$ is the mean of the population, (could either be known or an estimate as well). In simple terms this means \"The variance is the sum of squared deviations of each observed sample from the mean divided by the number of samples.\" The purpose of the square in the above would be to make each observed value become positive (if not they would very likley cancel each other out and give a poor representation of dispersion). Note how, it is increasingly difficult to describe in simple English what each of these statistical parameters are."
